# Steam Market Analysis Dashboard

## Overview

Steam Market Analysis Dashboard is a dashboard that explores a comprehensive dataset of Steam games and their metadata. It offers both static and customizable analyses, and it uniquely features project success projections generated by a blended classification model.

This project was developed for the "SCI 1402 - Projet en science des données" course at TÉLUQ University by Jean-Marie Prévost.

## Installation and Deployment

### Running the Deployed Version
The dashboard is available online at:  
[Steam Market Analysis Dashboard (Streamlit)](https://steam-market-analysis-dashboard-nzn37ojzujbps43zhj7twa.streamlit.app/)

*Note: There have been intermittent issues with the Streamlit deployment, which sometimes require a reboot of the app. The local deployment does not have this issue.*

### Running Locally
For local deployment, simply:
1. Download the latest release from the [release page](https://github.com/JeanMariePrevost/steam-market-analysis-dashboard/releases).
1. Unzip the contents.
2. Run the provided `launch_streamlit_locally.bat` to automatically create a venv in the same directory, install the requirements and run the app.

## Testing and Contributions

No automated tests have been set up for this project. This is a school project, and contributions are not expected at this stage.

## Steps to Build the datasets

If you wish to recreate the process from the start, you can aquire the source datasets (listed further below) and go through the following steps:

### Initial Merging and Preprocessing
1. Run **merging_pipeline.py** (ensure paths to input datasets are correct) to create the merged set from all selected sources.
2. You will end up with the fully-merged "/merge_output/combined_df_final.csv"
3. Run **general_preprocessing.py** to preprocess and clean up the merged set.
4. You will end up with the "human-readable" versions of the sets (with NAs and without one-hot encoding) as CSV for consultation, and as parquet for further usage, as "/output_preprocessed/..."

Note: The "dense" versions eliminate very sparse rows like unreleased or retired titles.
You can now use this dataset as is for various analyses.

### For general use with machine learning, continue with:
5. Run **feature_engineering.py** to further process the dataset into a form that is prepared for various machine learning techniques (e.g. by converting various categorical variables and lists using one-hot encoding, by imputing missing values...)

### For inference / predictions, continue with:
6. Run **inference_dataset_preprocessing.py** to generate the inference dataset
7. Run **inference_baseline_element.py** to calculate the "baseline" element for inference.

## Source Datasets

- **[Steam Games Dataset 2025](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/artermiloff/steam-games-dataset)**  
  *by Artemiy Ermilov*  
  Recent dataset; serves as the main base for the combined dataset.

- **[Game Recommendations on Steam](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/antonkozyriev/game-recommendations-on-steam)**  
  *by Anton Kozyriev*  
  Contains pertinent features such as Metacritic score, achievements, recommendations, and associated genres and tags.

- **[Steam Store Games (Clean dataset)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nikdavis/steam-store-games)**  
  *by Nik Davis*  
  General data including information from the SteamSpy API. Though slightly older, it provides enriched data that might have been omitted elsewhere.

- **[Steam Games Dataset 2025](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/srgiomanhes/steam-games-dataset-2025)**  
  *by Sérgio Manhães*  
  Offers interesting meta-data from external sources (GameFAQs, STSP, HowLongToBeat, Metacritic, IGDB); updated recently (1 month ago).

- **[Video Games on Steam (in JSON)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sujaykapadnis/games-on-steam)**  
  *by Sujay Kapadnis*  
  Rich in Steam metadata (languages, platforms, genres, categories, tags, achievements) and includes data from GameFAQs, Metacritic, IGDB, and HowLongToBeat. Its JSON format allowed for straightforward conversion.

- **[Steam Games Data from Steam API and Other Sources](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vicentearce/steamdata)**  
  *by Vicente Arce*  
  Provides details on co-operative play, online functionality, workshop use, available languages, reviews, gameplay time, max concurrent players (CCU), DLC, and demos. Note that this dataset is a bit dated (3 years old).

- **[HowLongToBeat Games / Completion Times](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kasumil5x/howlongtobeat-games-completion-times)**  
  *by KasumiL5x*  
  The only dataset without a Steam identifier (“appid”); matched on exact game titles, which may introduce collision errors, yet remains relevant for analysis.
